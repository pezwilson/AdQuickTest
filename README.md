# README

AdQuickTest is a Rails 5.1.2 application running on Ruby 2.4.2. It requires Postgres in order to run locally.

To use the application please unzip it, cd into its directory, then run:
 
<code>rails db:create</code>
<code>rails db:migrate</code>
<code>rails db:seed</code>
<code>rails s</code>

Everything should be pretty straightforward and self-apparent after that!
